                <h1> Hello, Welcome to the Dog Training Guide</h1>
                <div class = "typewriter">A little about myself: Ever since I was little, 
                    I have always loved dogs. I have volunteered at various dog shelters, and through those experiences, I have learned how to train dogs.
                     That is why I decided to create a website to help new dog owners, aspiring dog trainers, 
                     and dog enthusiasts learn how to train their dogs effectively. </div>
